Study the effect of promoter, coding, and cg content on mutation rate.
For promoters and coding windows, remove those that have "n/a" as gene names, for coding also remove utrs
ALso have Noonan Roadmap brain union as a categorical variable
only use synonymous mutations to estimate coding mutation rates for cases
