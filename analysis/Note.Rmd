Yuen et al., published a paper on Nature Neuroscience providing resources (*MSSNG*) for WGS data of autism individuals and showed examples where they identified new ASD genes from this data set (93% coverage for at least 40X). They reported **73.8** *de novo* SNVs/individual and **12.6** *de novo* indels/individual. The paper is at [here](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nn.4524.html). 
They have data from sequencing 5205 (5193 unique individuals)samples from autism families. The samples from ASD individuals include 2067 from males and 559 females. 

**Data access** All data are available from MSSNG Google cloud or linked databases.

  + provide all predicted damaging mutations from an subject or from one gene across subjects
  + psychometric measurements could be measured
  + online application for data access (https://research.mss.ng/)

The reason that **DLL1** was not found as an ASD risk gene is because the 50bp containing the mutation is incorrectly assinged to an other nearby gene (FAM120B). However the distance of this 50bp to DLL1 is still the shortest. The reason why 50bp is not assigned to the nearest gene is because I first assigned big intervals to nearest gene. Then I assianged a 50-bp window to a gene that is assigned to the big interval that contains the 50-bp window. This stratagy is not good enough. In the case here, there is a very big interval lying between TSSs of DLL1 and FAM120B, and it is a little closer to FAM120B, and then all the 50-windows in this big interval were assigned to FAM120B. But of course, there are several 50-bp that are actually closer to DLL1.

So I need to redo the 50-bp gene assignment. I need to update `../other_annotation/epigenomic_annotation/Whole_genome.promoter_yanyu_10kb_exons_no_utr_no_na_genes.50bp_window.bed_genename.bed`.
